## 🐛 Issues Identified & Fixed

### **1. CRITICAL: Centres Page Data Display Error**

**Issue:** `Undefined array key "address"` in centres index view
```
[2025-06-23 13:06:45] local.ERROR: Undefined array key "address" 
{"view":{"view":"/home/mifunez/CREAMS/resources/views/centres/index.blade.php","data":[]}
```

**Root Cause:** Controller was providing placeholder data missing required fields (address, phone, email)

**Fix Applied:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- Updated `CentreController.php` to provide complete data structure
- Added missing fields: address, phone, email for all 4 centres
- Now using realistic IIUM centre data

**Before:**
```php
[
    'id' => 1,
    'name' => 'Main Training Centre',
    'location' => 'City Centre',
    // Missing: address, phone, email
]
```

**After:**
```php
[
    'id' => 1,
    'name' => 'IIUM Gombak Centre',
    'location' => 'Gombak',
    'address' => 'Jalan Gombak, 53100 Kuala Lumpur',
    'phone' => '+603-6196-4000',
    'email' => 'gombak@creams.edu.my',
    // All required fields present
]
```

  - Renamed `FixUserRoles.php` → `FixUserRolesCommand.php`
  - Moved `AttendanceController.php` → `Activity/AttendanceController.php`
  - Moved Auth controllers to proper `Auth/` directory
  - Renamed `APIController.php` → `ApiController.php`

#### 🏗️ **New Service Layer Architecture**
Created comprehensive service-based dashboard system:

**Core Services Implemented:**
- `BaseDashboardService.php` - Shared functionality and caching
- `AdminDashboardService.php` - Admin-specific dashboard logic
- `TeacherDashboardService.php` - Teacher-specific dashboard logic
- `SupervisorDashboardService.php` - Supervisor-specific dashboard logic
- `AjkDashboardService.php` - AJK committee-specific dashboard logic
- `DashboardServiceFactory.php` - Service instantiation and management

**Key Features:**
- 5-minute intelligent caching with user-specific invalidation

- `38_create_asset_locations_table.php` - Hierarchical location management
- `39_create_asset_movements_table.php` - Movement tracking and audit
- `40_create_asset_maintenance_table.php` - Maintenance scheduling and history
- `41_enhance_asset_types_table.php` - Enhanced asset type capabilities
- `42_add_assigned_to_id_to_assets_table.php` - Backward compatibility

**Enhanced API Controller:**
- `AssetController.php` - RESTful API with 468 lines of comprehensive functionality
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Asset assignment and release workflows
- Bulk operations support
- Statistics and dashboard data endpoints
- File upload handling for asset images
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

**Dashboard Integration:**
- Enhanced `AjkDashboardService.php` with asset management integration
- Real-time asset statistics and financial metrics
- Maintenance alerts and operational metrics
- Asset distribution charts and utilization breakdown
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for error resilience

**Service Provider Configuration:**
- `AssetServiceProvider.php` - Dependency injection configuration

========================
Enhancement: Malaysian Curriculum Database Schema Migration
Date: December 18, 2024
Migration File: database/migrations/2024_12_18_create_malaysian_subjects_enhancement.php
Status: CREATED - Ready for Execution

OVERVIEW
--------
Created comprehensive database migration to enhance CREAMS with Malaysian special education
curriculum standards and disability accommodation framework for rehabilitation centers.

MIGRATION STRUCTURE
-------------------

1. ACTIVITIES TABLE ENHANCEMENTS
   Added columns to existing 'activities' table:
   
   a) subject_category (ENUM, nullable)
      Values: bahasa_malaysia, english_language, arabic_language, mathematics, 
              science, life_skills, physical_therapy, occupational_therapy, 
              speech_therapy, social_skills
      Purpose: Align activities with Malaysian curriculum subjects
   
   b) curriculum_level (ENUM, default: 'foundation')
      Values: pre_foundation, foundation, basic, adaptive
      Purpose: Map to Malaysian Foundation Standards educational levels
   
   c) standard_duration_minutes (INTEGER, default: 45)
      Purpose: Standard lesson duration for activity planning
   
   d) minimum_duration_minutes (INTEGER, default: 15)
      Purpose: Shortest acceptable duration for flexibility
   
   e) maximum_duration_minutes (INTEGER, default: 90)
      Purpose: Longest duration to prevent over-scheduling
   
   f) learning_outcomes (JSON, nullable)
      Purpose: Store Malaysian curriculum learning outcomes as structured data
   
   g) assessment_criteria (JSON, nullable)
      Purpose: Store assessment methods and criteria
   
   h) requires_special_accommodation (BOOLEAN, default: false)
      Purpose: Flag activities requiring disability accommodations

2. DISABILITY_ACCOMMODATIONS TABLE (NEW)
   Primary Purpose: Template-based accommodation recommendations
   
   Schema:
   - id: Primary key
   - disability_type: ENUM of recognized disability categories
   - subject_category: ENUM matching activity subjects
   - recommended_duration_minutes: Suggested lesson length
   - break_frequency_minutes: Required break intervals
   - teaching_strategies: JSON array of recommended methods
   - assessment_modifications: JSON array of assessment adaptations
   - special_notes: TEXT for additional guidance
   - timestamps: Created/updated tracking
   
   Unique Constraint: [disability_type, subject_category]
   Ensures one template per disability-subject combination

3. TRAINEE_SUBJECT_ADAPTATIONS TABLE (NEW)
   Primary Purpose: Individual trainee customizations
   
   Schema:
   - id: Primary key
   - trainee_id: Foreign key to trainees table (CASCADE DELETE)
   - subject_category: ENUM matching activity subjects
   - adapted_duration_minutes: Personalized lesson duration
   - break_frequency_minutes: Individual break requirements
   - accommodations: JSON array of specific adaptations
   - teacher_notes: TEXT for educator guidance
   - requires_aide: BOOLEAN for support staff needs
   - timestamps: Created/updated tracking
   
   Unique Constraint: [trainee_id, subject_category]
   Ensures one adaptation record per trainee-subject combination

DISABILITY CATEGORIES SUPPORTED
-------------------------------
1. Autism Spectrum Disorder
2. Down Syndrome
3. Cerebral Palsy
4. Hearing Impairment
5. Visual Impairment
6. Intellectual Disability
7. Physical Disability
8. Speech and Language Disorder
9. Learning Disability
10. Multiple Disabilities

SUBJECT CATEGORIES ALIGNMENT
----------------------------
Malaysian Curriculum Subjects:
- Bahasa Malaysia (Primary language)
- English Language (Secondary language)
- Arabic Language (Religious education)
- Mathematics (Numeracy skills)
- Science (Basic scientific concepts)
- Life Skills (Daily living, vocational)

Therapy Categories:
- Physical Therapy
- Occupational Therapy
- Speech Therapy
- Social Skills Training

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
------------------------

Data Integrity:
- Foreign key constraints with proper cascade rules
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate configurations
- ENUM values ensure data consistency
- JSON validation for structured fields

Performance Optimization:
- Indexed foreign keys for fast lookups
- Unique constraints double as performance indexes
- Minimal table joins required for common queries

Storage Efficiency:
- ENUM fields reduce storage vs VARCHAR
- JSON fields for variable-length arrays
- Appropriate field sizes for expected data ranges

BUSINESS LOGIC INTEGRATION
--------------------------

Accommodation Hierarchy:
1. Individual trainee adaptations (highest priority)
2. Disability-based templates (medium priority)
3. Activity defaults (lowest priority)

Duration Calculation Logic:
- Respects minimum/maximum boundaries
- Considers break frequency requirements
- Adapts to individual trainee needs

Assessment Adaptation:
- Maintains educational standards
- Provides alternative assessment methods
- Supports diverse learning needs

COMPLIANCE FEATURES
-------------------

Educational Standards:
- Aligns with Malaysian Ministry of Education guidelines
- Supports individualized education programs (IEPs)
- Enables curriculum-based assessment

Data Protection:
- Secure storage of sensitive disability information
- Audit trail through timestamp fields
- Proper data relationships for integrity

Accessibility:
- Comprehensive accommodation framework
- Multiple adaptation levels
- Inclusive design principles

ROLLBACK STRATEGY
-----------------

The migration includes a complete down() method that:
1. Drops new tables (trainee_subject_adaptations, disability_accommodations)
2. Removes added columns from activities table
3. Preserves existing data integrity
4. Can be executed safely if issues arise

DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

Pre-deployment:
- Backup existing database
- Verify Laravel migration environment
- Ensure proper database permissions

Post-deployment:
- Run DisabilityAccommodationsSeeder
- Update existing activities with subject categories
- Train staff on new features
- Monitor system performance

TESTING CHECKLIST
------------------
□ Migration runs successfully
□ Foreign key constraints work
□ Unique constraints prevent duplicates
□ JSON fields accept valid data
□ ENUM values enforce allowed options
□ Rollback migration works
□ Data integrity maintained
□ Performance benchmarks met

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------
- Sensitive disability data requires proper access controls
- JSON fields validated to prevent injection attacks
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- Audit logging for accommodation changes

MAINTENANCE NOTES
-----------------
- Regular review of accommodation templates
- Update disability categories as needed
- Monitor JSON field usage and performance
- Periodic data cleanup of unused adaptations

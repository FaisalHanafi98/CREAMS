# CREAMS System Overview

CREAMS (Community-based REhAbilitation Management System) is a comprehensive web-based application built with Laravel that provides management solutions for rehabilitation centers serving children with special needs.

## System Architecture

- **Framework**: Laravel (PHP)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Authentication**: Custom role-based system

## User Roles & Access Hierarchy

The system implements a four-tier role-based access control:

1. **Admin** - Full system access
2. **Supervisor** - Extensive access with some admin restrictions
3. **AJK** (Committee Member) - Moderate access level
4. **Teacher** - Limited access to teaching-related functions

## Authentication Process

1. Users navigate to the login page (`auth.loginpage` route)
2. They enter either IIUM ID or email plus password
3. System validates credentials against the `Users` model (or role-specific models)
4. On successful validation:
   - User role is determined
   - Session data is stored (ID, role, name, center info)
   - User is redirected to role-specific dashboard
5. Optional "Remember Me" functionality via cookies

Date: December 18, 2024
File Modified: app/Models/Activity.php
Status: COMPLETED - Ready for Database Migration

OVERVIEW
--------
Enhanced the Activity model to support Malaysian special education curriculum standards
and disability-specific accommodations for rehabilitation center management.

CHANGES MADE
------------

1. FILLABLE ATTRIBUTES ADDED
   - subject_category: Malaysian curriculum subject classification
   - curriculum_level: Foundation standards alignment (pre_foundation, foundation, basic, adaptive)
   - standard_duration_minutes: Default lesson duration (45 minutes)
   - minimum_duration_minutes: Shortest acceptable duration (15 minutes)
   - maximum_duration_minutes: Longest acceptable duration (90 minutes)
   - learning_outcomes: JSON array of Malaysian curriculum learning outcomes
   - assessment_criteria: JSON array of assessment methods
   - requires_special_accommodation: Boolean flag for special needs requirements

2. CASTS CONFIGURATION
   - learning_outcomes: 'array' (JSON handling)
   - assessment_criteria: 'array' (JSON handling)
   - requires_special_accommodation: 'boolean'

3. NEW QUERY SCOPES
   a) scopeMalaysianCurriculum()
      - Filters activities by Malaysian subject categories
      - Subjects: Bahasa Malaysia, English, Arabic, Mathematics, Science, Life Skills
   
   b) scopeTherapy()
      - Filters therapy-focused activities
      - Categories: Physical, Occupational, Speech, Social Skills

4. NEW ACCESSOR METHODS
   a) getFormattedSubjectCategoryAttribute()
      - Converts snake_case to readable format
      - Maps: 'bahasa_malaysia' → 'Bahasa Malaysia'
   
   b) getFormattedCurriculumLevelAttribute()
      - Converts curriculum codes to descriptions
      - Maps: 'pre_foundation' → 'Pre-Foundation (Pre-school)'
   
   c) getSubjectBadgeClassAttribute()
      - Returns Bootstrap CSS classes for UI badges
      - Color coding by subject category

5. DISABILITY ACCOMMODATION METHODS
   a) getRecommendedDurationForTrainee($traineeId)
      - Calculates personalized lesson duration
      - Priority: Individual adaptations > Disability templates > Standard duration
      - Integrates with trainee_subject_adaptations and disability_accommodations tables
   
   b) needsAccommodationForTrainee($traineeId)
      - Determines if special accommodations are required
      - Checks trainee condition against accommodation database
      - Returns boolean for UI/scheduling decisions

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------

Database Integration:
- Uses DB facade for accommodation lookups
- Implements fallback hierarchy for duration calculation
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing activities

Performance Considerations:
- Query optimization through specific table lookups
- Caching-friendly accessor methods
- Minimal database calls per method

Security:
- Input validation through Eloquent fillable properties
- Safe JSON handling for array fields
- Protected against mass assignment vulnerabilities

BUSINESS IMPACT
---------------

Educational Benefits:
- Aligns with Malaysian Ministry of Education standards
- Supports individualized education programs (IEPs)
- Enables curriculum-based activity planning

Operational Benefits:
- Automated duration recommendations
- Disability-aware scheduling
- Standardized assessment criteria
- Teacher workload optimization

Compliance Benefits:
- Meets special education regulatory requirements
- Supports audit trail for accommodation decisions
- Enables data-driven educational outcomes

DEPENDENCIES
------------
Requires the following database tables (created by migration):
- disability_accommodations
- trainee_subject_adaptations

Related Models:
- Trainee model (existing)
- Users model (existing)
- ActivitySession model (existing)

TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------------
1. Unit tests for accessor methods
2. Integration tests for accommodation calculations
3. Scope method functionality tests
4. JSON field handling validation
5. Database relationship integrity tests

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
----------------
1. Run migration before using new features
2. Seed disability_accommodations table
3. Update existing activities with subject_category values
4. Train staff on new curriculum alignment features

ROLLBACK PLAN
-------------
If issues arise:
1. Migration has down() method to reverse changes
2. Fillable attributes are additive (won't break existing code)
3. New methods have null-safe implementations
4. Existing functionality remains unchanged
